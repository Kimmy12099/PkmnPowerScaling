# Question to answer: is there a correlation between evolutionary stages and base stat total of a generation 

#1. Create a new excel file called "evolutoary stage and pokemon_id"
        #Columns: pokemon_id, pokemon_name, Stage 1/2/3, Evolves into:, base stat total of pokemon, generation
        #for base stat total of Pokemon, use the PokemonCompleteStats.xlsx file; If Pokemon_id = pokemon_id, then put pokemon BST in a column 
#2. Create a new column called "evolution stage (1, 2, 3)" and fill in the values
#3. *IMPORTANT* find a website/data that shows the evolutionary stages of all Pokemon (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_evolutionary_line)
      #Use pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl
      #After you download everything, clean the data
#4. Divide Pokemon into 9 generations 
#5. Divide Pokemon into 3 evolutionary stages (combined with #4)
#6. Find the average base stat total of each generation for each evolutionary stage 
#7. Also count how many stage 1,2,3 Pokemon are in each generation too and/or averages 
#8. Data visualization for #6 and #7 (smth like matplotlib or seaborn)

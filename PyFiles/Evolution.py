# Question to answer: is there a correlation between evolutionary stages and base stat total of a generation 

#1. Access PokemonCompletestats Excel file 
#2. Create a new column called "evolution stage (1, 2, 3)" and fill in the values
#3. *IMPORTANT* find a program that shows the evolutionary stages of all Pokemon 
#4. Divide Pokemon into 9 generations 
#5. Divide Pokemon into 3 evolutionary stages (combined with #4)
#6. Find the average base stat total of each generation for each evolutionary stage 
#7. Also count how many stage 1,2,3 Pokemon are in each generation too and/or averages 
#8.  Data visualization for #6 and #7 (smth like matplotlib or seaborn)

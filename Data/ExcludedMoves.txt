These moves were excluded because of... 
A. These moves are very strong "one time moves" or "you can use for 3 turns" 
(Z-Moves & Dynamax + Gigantamax moves) and will skew the results 
B. Moves that are calculated based off "something", because the base power (or fixed damage) is variable 
C. Some moves are not useable ingame (like eternabeam, light of ruin)
D. Fixed damage does not equal base power
